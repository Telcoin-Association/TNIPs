<!--
  READ TNIP GUIDELINES (https://tnips.telcoin.org/TNIPS) BEFORE USING THIS TEMPLATE!

  This is the suggested template for new TNIPs. After you have filled in the requisite fields, please delete these comments.

  Note that a TNIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your TNIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

  The title should be 44 characters or less. It should not repeat the TNIP number in title, irrespective of the category.

## Abstract

<!--
  The  Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read the abstract and get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation

<!--
  The Motivation section is critical for TNIPs that want to change the Telcoin Network protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the TNIP solves. This section may be brief if the motivation is evident.

  With a few exceptions, external links are not allowed. If you feel that a particular resource would demonstrate a compelling case for your TNIP, then save it as a printer-friendly PDF, put it in the assets folder, and link to that copy.

## Specification

<!--
  The Specification section should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed.

  It is recommended to follow RFC 2119 and RFC 8170. Do not remove the key word definitions if RFC 2119 and RFC 8170 are followed.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

## Rationale

<!--
  The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other protocols. The rationale should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion around the TNIP.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

TBD

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--

  This section is optional.

  All TNIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their consequences. The TNIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. This section may be omitted if the proposal does not introduce any backwards incompatibilities, but this section must be included if backward incompatibilities exist.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting
-->

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Test Cases

<!--
  The Test Cases section is mandatory for TNIPs. Tests should either be inlined in the TNIP as data (such as input/expected output pairs) or listed as test cases with outcomes.
  If the test suite is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/tnip-####/`. External links are not allowed.

## Reference Implementation

<!--
  This section is optional.

  The Reference Implementation section should include a minimal implementation that assists in understanding or implementing this specification. It should not include project build files. The reference implementation is not a replacement for the Specification section, and the proposal should still be understandable without it.
  If the reference implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/tnip-####/`. External links are not allowed.

## Security Considerations

<!--
  All TNIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. TNIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. A TNIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.

  The current placeholder is acceptable for a draft.

  TODO: Remove this comment before submitting

Needs discussion.
